My project euler code.

Edit: 3 was really hard for me. Testing for whether a number is a prime or not was a pain. My initial program used trial-division method, and that took over an hour. Now I use Miller-Rabin, though itâ€™s still kind of slow. I will update on my project euler progress on my blog.

Edit: Finished 1 and 2. Were easy
